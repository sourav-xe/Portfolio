                    I used HTML to structure the page and applied a bit of CSS for animations and areas where Bootstrap's built-in components werenâ€™t suitable. However, most of the styling is done using Bootstrap to ensure consistency and responsiveness. Used my extra skill to make it looks more good implement logic and its very styled. iadded animation and multiples keyframe and media queries too.

                <p>I created a Netflix clone using HTML and CSS, focusing on a clean and responsive design. The structure is built with HTML, while most of the styling is handled using Bootstrap for consistency and efficiency. Custom CSS was used for animations and specific design elements where Bootstrap's built-in features were not sufficient. This project showcases my ability to recreate modern web interfaces with a strong emphasis on user experience and visual appeal.</p>
